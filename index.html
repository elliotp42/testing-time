                <p> Hey there, my name is Elliot, and I am a junior in Games & Interactive Media here at MSU. I am from Munising, Michigan, a small town in the Upper Peninsula, and as such, love to spend my free time exploring nature.
                    I decided to change my major to Games & Interactive Media during my sophomore year because Computer Science did not feel like the right fit for me, and I've always been interested in video games since a young age, from spending time playing 
                    Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga with my dad, to playing multiplayer games with my friends in high school.  </p>

            <h2> Mountain Biking: a lifelong hobby </h2>
            <div class="box3">
                <p> Mountain Biking is a hobby that I picked since learning how to bike at the age of 13. I genuinely believe that Mountain Biking is one of the best hobbies that anyone can have, as people of any skill can go mountain biking, and it's a fun way to get excercise in and explore nature.

            <h3>Types of trails and difficulty levels</h3>
            <div class = "box3">
                <p>There are various skill levels and styles of trails that you can consider when you go biking.</p>
                <p> As far as skill ratings go, there are typically Green (Easy), Blue (Intermediate), Black Diamond (Difficult), and Double Black Diamond (Expert) </p>
                <p> There are also multiple styles of trails, from fast-paced jump trails, to tech trails that challenge your skills of maneuvering on your bike, and then my personal favorite type: flow trails. Flow trails don't require you to have a ton of skill, but instead let's you just go as fast as possible.</p>

            <h3> Gear needed to get started </h3>
            <div class = "box3"> 
                <p>The best part about mountain biking, is that while you can spend thousands of dollars to get a really nice bike, a solid helmet, a water bottle, and a random bike from your garage is all you really need to get started.</p>

            <h3>Resources and Useful Websites</h4>
            <div class = "box3"> 
                <p>There are a lot of useful resources if you are interested in Mountian Biking, which I will link to below. </p>
                <p> ~ WorldWideCyclery and BackCountry are both resources for actually purchasing Mountain Biking Supplies.</p>
                <p> ~ ParkTool is also an online shop, but it is also a very useful database of information on how to repair your bike.</p>
                <p> ~ TrailForks is a resource for finding and downloading trail maps for use on the go. </p>
                <p> ~ This last link is definitely not biased, but this store is in my hometown, and the owner has two Britney Spaniels who will absolutely love you.</p>
